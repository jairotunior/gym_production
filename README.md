# Production Factory System Gym Environment

A production factory system implemented like an environment in gym. The library let you develop production factory models and applied Reinforcement learning in Gym Toolkit. You could apply differents state of the art algorithm in Deep Reinforcement Learning.
The Goal of the proyect is create an agent that have the ability of manage a production system.

The modelling API let you create any type of flow system easy. The library is like [Keras library](https://keras.io/) for creating models.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

For utilize the project completely you must install the **graphviz** library in  your computer:

**In Linux**

```
apt-get install graphviz
```

**In Windows**

You can download the latest installer [here](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/Download/windows/graphviz-2.38.zip)

In case of troubles you need to add the path in **Environment Variables**.

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz2.38\bin
```

### Installing

1. Create a new virtual environment with your prefered tools
2. Copy the repositiory https://github.com/jairotunior/gym_production.git
3. Install the dependencies

```
pip install -r requeriments.txt
```

That's all for use.
